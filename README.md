# PdfScribe v1.0.9

PdfScribe is a PDF virtual printer. Check the [releases](https://github.com/stchan/PdfScribe/releases) page for this project to download a prebuilt MSI package.

## System Requirements

* 64-bit Windows 7 or later
* .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later

## Building from source

Visual Studio 2017, Wix 3.11, and Votive 2017 are required to build PdfScribe.

PdfScribe links to, and distributes the following third party components:

* Microsoft Postscript Printer Driver (V3)
* Ghostscript (64-bit)
* Redmon 1.9 (64-bit)

## License

PdfScribe is AGPL.


## Configuration
 
In the application config file (PdfScribe.exe.config), there are the following settings in the "applicationSettings" element:

* ****AskUserForOutputFilename**** - set value to *true* if you want PdfScribe to ask the user where to save the PDF.
* ****OutputFile**** - if there is a constant filename you want the PDF to be saved to, set its value here. Environment variables can be used. PdfScribe will overwrite each time. This setting is ignored if  **AskUserForOutputFilename** is set to *true*. Note that a literal % character cannot be used even though it is legal in a Windows filename.
* ****OpenAfterCreating**** - set value to *true* if you want the PDF automatically opened with the default viewer. This setting is ignored if the file extension is not .PDF

## Known Issues
* ~~As of Windows 10 build 1903 (though this issue has been reported as early as build 1709), the bundled port monitor (Redmon 1.9) always runs as the SYSTEM user, so any dialog boxes (like for setting the filename) never appear on the user's desktop. Windows 7 does not appear to be affected. (See issue #17)~~ Potentially fixed in v1.0.9 - please go to issue #17 and report your experience if you had this problem. Thanks to @tahoop for the Redmon modification.

## Release notes
#### v1.0.9
* Redmon modification for issue #17 by @tahoop (Dialog box for filename not appearing).
#### v1.0.8
* Fix for issue #26 (bug with filename containing unicode/utf8 letters)
#### v1.0.7
* Fix for issue #13 (Couldn't use environment variable in output filename).
* Now defaults to use the print spooler rather than direct printing. (issue #14)

#### v1.0.6
* Added option to automatically open PDF in the default viewer (enhancement request from issue #4).

#### v1.0.5
* Installer package now properly removes older versions during a major upgrade. If you are upgrading from v1.0.4 or older, manually remove the old version first - the UninstallPrinter custom action is never called during an upgrade.

## To do

* Allow auto-generated filenames with sequence numbers if the user doesn't want to overwrite (ex: OUTPUT-001.PDF, OUTPUT-002.PDF, etc)
* Allow file appending if **OutputFile** setting is used.
* GUI for configuration
* Watermarking output
